# My address book

- Crate a little address book app
- At the start, just show a form for creating addresses
- When a user creates an address with the form, display it in the list of addresses
- Save the updated list of addresses to localstorage when a new address is added
- Use lifecycle methods like this
    1. when the component is first displayed, show a "Loading..." message instead of the users list
    2. create a delay of three seconds
    3. after three seconds, get the data from local storage and display it


- *BONUS* Make it so you can delete addresses too
